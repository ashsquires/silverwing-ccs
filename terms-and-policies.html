            4.1 The Services allow Buyers to purchase Products from Suppliers using two pricing methods (both of which are described more fully in section 4.6):
          </p>
          <div class="sublist-indent">
            <p>

            <p>
              II. Using a Price Curve creating the opportunity to qualify for discounts in the form of &lsquo;Price Curve Credits&rsquo;, for the purchases the Buyer makes.

            <a name="_heading=h.3dy6vkm">
            </a>
            4.2 The Call Off Contract exclusively governs the purchase of Products by the Buyer from the relevant Supplier. To the extent there are any terms in the Call Off Contract that conflict or are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Buyer agrees it shall vary such Call Off Contract to the extent of overcoming the conflict or inconsistency only. Silverwing only provides the services as outlined in this section 4.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.3 For Fixed Price Purchases, the Buyer directly places the order with the Supplier using the Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.4 For purchases using a Price Curve, the Buyer places the order via Silverwing utilising the Platform. Silverwing will notify the relevant Supplier of any orders and the relevant Supplier subsequently notifies Silverwing that they accept the order subject to the Call Off Contract. Once Silverwing receives this notification, Silverwing will conclude the transaction on the Buyer&rsquo;s behalf with the Supplier and the order will be considered accepted and where the relevant Product(s) have an associated Price Curve will constitute a Qualifying Purchase.

            <p>
              4.5.1 The pricing structure for some products sold by Suppliers via the Platform is visible to Buyers as a graph showing price in pounds against the quantity of units sold. This graph is known as the Price Curve and is distinct for each relevant product available for purchase. For the avoidance of doubt not all products available for Buyers to purchase from Suppliers via the Platform will have an associated Price Curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.5.2 Through the Platform a Buyer is able to purchase products in accordance with their Relevant Price Curve, where applicable.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.5.3 Each Price Curve is only available during the Offer Period. Once the Offer Period has ended, no further purchases of that product will count toward the generation of Price Curve Credits under the Relevant Price Curve. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no limit to the number of subsequent offers that can be created for each product.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.5.4 The Current Price of each Product at any given time within the Offer Period is dependent on the cumulative volume of units sold for that Product within all Qualifying Purchases, in accordance with the Relevant Price Curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.5.5 As a Buyer inputs their specified quantity of a Product, their Price Payable updates in accordance with the Relevant Price Curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.5.6 Upon acceptance of the relevant order, the Price Payable for that specific Order will be locked as the Price Due and the Current Price will for the Offer will be updated in real-time.

              4.5.7 All prices are shown on the Relevant Price Curve excluding VAT.

            <p>
              4.5.8 In accordance with the Price Due and the Current Price and the pricing structure set out by the Price Curve under which a Qualifying Purchase was made, Price Curve Credits (see Section 4.7) will be displayed as a positive account balance on the Account.

              4.6.3.1 In accordance with your authorisation of Silverwing to act as your agent (Section 3.2) and notwithstanding the provisions of the Call Off Contract, you will pay Silverwing in full the Price Due on 25 calendar days (or less) from the date of the Supplier&rsquo;s invoice. Such payment shall be made by way of bank transfer to an account nominated by Silverwing. The receipt by Silverwing of the Price Due in full will extinguish your obligation to pay the Supplier under the Call Off Contract in respect of the Qualifying Purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.6.3.2 Upon Silverwing&rsquo;s receipt of payment in full of the Price Due, we will confirm receipt of your payment, and we will initiate onward payment of the Price Payable on your behalf to the Supplier within five (5) calendar days of receipt from you.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.6.3.3 The Supplier will notify Silverwing once they have received payment in full for the Qualifying Purchase. Once we receive confirmation from the Supplier of a payment in full in relation to the Qualifying Purchase, we will change the status of the Price Curve Credits on your Account from Pending to Redeemable. Redeemable Price Curve Credits may then be used in accordance with section 4.7 (Price Curve Credits).
            </p>
            <p>
              4.6.3.4 For the avoidance of doubt, it is the Supplier that extends you any Supplier Credit Facility and not Silverwing.

            <p>
              4.6.3.5 If you are in dispute with the payment with the Supplier, for the Qualifying Purchase, your dispute is with the Supplier and not Silverwing.

            </p>
            <p>
              4.7.2 Buyers will be able to see a positive balance on their Account (Price Curve Credits) where, in accordance with the Relevant Price Curve, the Current Price of the offer is less than the Price Due. The Price Curve Credits appearing on an Account will be equal to the difference between the Price Due less the Current Price. Price Curve Credits will continue to accrue on the Account until the Offer Period ends, at which point no further Price Curve Credits will accrue in relation to that Relevant Price Curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.7.3 Price Curve Credits represent the savings on the Price Due that the Supplier has been able to pass onto Silverwing account holders, due to the collective impact of all Silverwing account holder purchases made against the Relevant Price Curve. The Price Curve Credits are provided at the sole discretion of the Supplier. You will receive a credit note from the Supplier to reflect the generation of Price Curve Credits. A reduction in the Current Price will instantly result in Price Curve Credits showing on the Accounts of all Silverwing account holders who made Qualifying Purchases under the Relevant Price Curve. The Buyer is able to view their Price Curve Credits on the Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.7.4 Price Curve Credits will show as Pending and will not be Redeemable for use by the Buyer until Silverwing has received payment in full of the Price Due.

              4.7.5 It is the responsibility of the Buyer and Supplier to ensure appropriate accounting for VAT on any purchases made via the Platform and any Price Curve Credits you receive, in accordance with the Call Off Contract and all applicable laws, legislation and accounting standards.

              4.7.6 In accordance with section 3.2 You authorise Silverwing to act as your agent for the purposes of receiving Redeemable Price Curve Credits from the Supplier. Redeemable Price Curve Credits will be held in trust on your behalf until your redemption, in accordance with section 4.8.
